# [Data Science Internship](https://github.com/Priyadharshan2003/OIBSIP-DATA-SCIENCE)

## This repository contains the outcomes of my Data Science internship. During this internship, I worked on various projects related to data analysis, machine learning, and data visualization.

## Tasks

### [Iris Flower Classification](https://github.com/Priyadharshan2003/OIBSIP-DATA-SCIENCE/tree/main/Task-1_Flower_Iris) - In this project, I analyzed and classified the iris flower species using machine learning algorithms. I used the famous Iris dataset to train my models and evaluate their performance.

### [Unemployment Analysis](https://github.com/Priyadharshan2003/OIBSIP-DATA-SCIENCE/tree/main/Task-2_unemployment) - In this project, I analyzed the unemployment rates from given dataset. I visualized the data and found patterns and trends in the data using Python's data visualization libraries.

### [Car Price Prediction](https://github.com/Priyadharshan2003/OIBSIP-DATA-SCIENCE/tree/main/Task-3_Car_Price_Prediction) - In this project, I built a machine learning model to predict the prices of used cars. I used the famous  dataset and trained my model using regression algorithms.

### [Email Spam Classification](https://github.com/Priyadharshan2003/OIBSIP-DATA-SCIENCE/tree/main/Task-4_Email_Spam) - In this project, I built a machine learning model to classify emails as spam or not spam. I used the famous SpamBase dataset to train my model and evaluated its performance using various metrics.

### [Sales Prediction](https://github.com/Priyadharshan2003/OIBSIP-DATA-SCIENCE/tree/main/Task-5_Sales_Predict) - In this project, I built a machine learning model to predict the sales of a product based on various factors such as advertising cost, target audience, and platform. I used the Advertising dataset and trained my model using linear regression.

## I have provided the code and detailed explanation for each of these tasks in their respective directories.
